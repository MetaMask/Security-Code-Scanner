# Security Code Scanner

## Overview
The Security Code Scanner GitHub Action is designed to enhance the security of your repositories by 
performing thorough code scans. Currently, it utilizes the Appsec CodeQL scanner, 
but the scope is planned to expand to include other security actions, 
providing a more comprehensive security analysis.

## Inputs
- **`repo`**: (Required) The name of the repository you want to scan.

## How to Use
To use the Security Code Scanner, add the following steps to your workflow file:

```yaml
name: Security Scan

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Check out repo to scan
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        repository: ${{ github.repository }}
        
    - name: Security Code Scanner
      uses: <your-username>/Security-Code-Scanner@v1
      with:
        repo: ${{ github.repository }}
```

Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username or organization name where the action is hosted.

## Features
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Leverages the robust CodeQL scanning tool from MetaMask/Appsec-CodeQL to identify vulnerabilities in the codebase.

## Future Plans
The action is in its initial phase, and we plan to integrate additional security scanning tools to widen our security coverage.
